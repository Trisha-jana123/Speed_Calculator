# 🏥 Healthcare Management System (Google Colab - Python)

This is a healthcare record management system developed entirely in **Python** using **Google Colab**. It simulates a real-world clinic/hospital environment, managing patient details and appointments using simple in-memory data structures or CSV files.

> ⚠️ No GUI or database is used — the project runs in notebook cells with input prompts and print outputs. Ideal for education, demos, or simple use cases.
